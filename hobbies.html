    <h2>Photography:</h2>
    <p>Even though I acknowledge I am an awful photographer and don't really invest in the best equipment, I have to admit I have a passion for it.  The mere fact that it allows me to capture the essence of the feelings I get when I travel is enough to make me come back at it time after time.</p>

    <h2>Food:</h2>
    <p>I am obsessed with food, literally obsessed.  It's a passion of mine but also a temptation, so I always try to save the calorie count for this that are really worth it!</p>
